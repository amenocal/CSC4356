##Projects done in Interactive Computer Graphics Class(CSC4356) at LSU

##Prog 1: Getting Started - WebGl

Learn how to organize HTML and JavaSCript code for it to work with WebGL project.

Draws a single WebGL point to an HTML canvas.

##Prog 2: Triforce

Experience with WebGl to display Geometry. We defined a simple geometric figure, we triggered the rendering of the figure by the GPU.

##Prog 3: Function Grapher

Understanding of vertex buffer by generating a geometric figure in JavaScript code, we conveyed that definition to the GPU, and triggered the rendering of the figure by the GPU.

Implemented code to generate a mesh in the xz-plane and we render it as triangles. The output will be a 3D graph of an inverted paraboloid, like a graphing calculator migh produce.

##Prog 4: Better Function Grapher

Use of transformation for viewing. We Modified the implementation of Prog 3 to imrove the appearance of the redered function and to allow the user to interactively view it from any angle and distance.

We displayed the inverted paraboloid and rendered a gird of black lines on top of the triangle mesh. This involved the introduction of a uniform variable to disable the appearance of color, it could be considered as Light.

##Prog 5: Shaded Model Viewer

Purpose of this project was to practice basic gemotry processing and shaded rendering. This program takes a table of vertices and triangles in JSON format, it calculates a smoothen normal for each vertex, render the resulting data using basic lightning, and allow the user to tumble the shaded model using the mouse.
